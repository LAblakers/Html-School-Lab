        Although his favorite equation is E=mc<sup>2</sup>, Blake eats lunch at Innotech College. Innotech College is where he goes to school now and now he enjoys html almost as much as eating lunch. Blakes lunch is always brought to Innotech College where he then eats it. Please be at the college by 5:00p.m.<sup>1</sup>
